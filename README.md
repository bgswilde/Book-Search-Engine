Use the command 'git clone' in your command line with the link of this repo while navigated to your desired directory to copy this repo to your machine, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in your command line in the root folder of this application to install dependencies. Use the command 'npm run develop' in the root folder to concurrently run the graphql server and the react dev environment. For production deployment, use 'npm run build'. To create your own react app from start using npx, use "npx create-react-app" in your command line. You can also check out [React's documentation here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for more on creating a react app. For more on implementing GraphQL using Apollo, check out [Apollo's documentation here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/).

## Usage
- Deployed Use:
To use this application, use the deployed link below to search books, signing up or logging in to save books. This application uses the Google Books API for getting book data from the search. Without signup or login, you can search books and display more information on a chosen book. By clicking signup or login and filling out the form, you will be able to save books to your book list. In that saved book list, you go back and view book details or remove them from your list.
- Local Use:
Follow the installation instructions above. If you'd like to customize the data using different endpoints from Google Books API after installing this repo locally, see the data you can get at the [Google Books API documentation](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using). To test out your graphql queries/mutations and your react front end, run "npm run develop" from the root folder of this application in your command line.

The app was a working React application with connected API through mongoose, which I converted the functionality over to GraphQL. All mutations and queries, javascript functions and react hooks to call those queries and mutations, graphQL connection in the server, and some of the conditional rendering is my code.
